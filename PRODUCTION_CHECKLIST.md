## Deployment Steps

1. **Backup**
   - [ ] Database backup completed
   - [ ] Configuration files backed up
   - [ ] Current production build archived

2. **Build**
   - [ ] Run `npm run type-check`
   - [ ] Run `npm run test`
   - [ ] Run `npm run build`
   - [ ] Validate build output

3. **Deploy**
   - [ ] Update nginx configuration
   - [ ] Deploy new build to production servers
   - [ ] Update database schemas (if needed)
   - [ ] Clear relevant caches

4. **Verify**
   - [ ] Site loads correctly
   - [ ] SSL is working
   - [ ] API endpoints are responding
   - [ ] Authentication works
   - [ ] Core features are functional
   - [ ] No errors in logs

## Post-Deployment

1. **Monitor**
   - [ ] Watch error rates
   - [ ] Monitor performance metrics
   - [ ] Check user reports/feedback

2. **Document**
   - [ ] Update changelog
   - [ ] Document any issues/solutions
   - [ ] Update technical documentation

3. **Cleanup**
   - [ ] Remove old builds
   - [ ] Clean up temporary files
   - [ ] Update backup schedules

## Rollback Plan

1. **Triggers**
   - Critical error rates exceed threshold
   - Major functionality broken
   - Security vulnerability discovered

2. **Rollback Steps**
   - [ ] Restore previous build
   - [ ] Restore database backup (if needed)
   - [ ] Revert configuration changes
   - [ ] Update DNS/routing

3. **Verification**
   - [ ] Verify system functionality
   - [ ] Check data integrity
