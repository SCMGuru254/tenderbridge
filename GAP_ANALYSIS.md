- **Build Errors**: TypeScript compilation failures preventing deployment
- **Provider Configuration**: Inconsistent React Context provider setup
- **Status**: **CRITICAL** - App cannot run reliably

#### 2. Missing Authentication System
- **Current State**: No working authentication implementation
- **Impact**: Users cannot login, register, or access personalized features
- **Required For**: Job saving, profile management, social features
- **Status**: **CRITICAL** - Essential for core functionality

#### 3. Database Integration Issues
- **RLS Policies**: Implemented but unusable without authentication
- **Data Access**: Many features rely on user authentication that doesn't exist
- **API Endpoints**: Edge functions exist but cannot be properly tested
- **Status**: **HIGH** - Blocks most dynamic features
