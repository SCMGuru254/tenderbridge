# Pending Tasks - TenderBridge Job Portal

## ðŸš¨ DEVIL'S ADVOCATE CRITICAL ISSUES - PRODUCTION BLOCKERS

### CATEGORY A: INCOMPLETE FEATURE SET (60% Missing)
**Major Problem**: 9 out of 15 core pages are completely missing implementations
**Business Impact**: Users will encounter broken links and 404 errors
**Missing Pages**: Blog, Analytics, Networking, Affiliate, Privacy, Terms, Security, Forms, Free Services, FAQ, Social Hub, PayPal Portal
**Recommendation**: Fully implement all missing pages with UI, backend, API layer logic, and tables

### CATEGORY B: MOBILE EXPERIENCE GAPS  
**PWA Incomplete**: No service worker caching, no offline capability
**Performance**: No virtualization for job lists (will crash with 1000+ jobs)
**UX**: No swipe gestures, no pull-to-refresh
**Mobile Navigation**: Basic implementation needs enhancement

### CATEGORY C: DATABASE SCALABILITY ISSUES
**Job Queries**: No pagination on job lists (will slow down with volume)
**No Indexing Strategy**: Missing database indexes for search performance  
**No Caching**: Every request hits the database directly
**RLS Security**: 8 security warnings in database configuration

## ðŸš¨ Critical (Blocks Production)
